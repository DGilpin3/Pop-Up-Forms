# Week 3 Lab: Popup Form with Animation 🖼️✨

## 📖 Lab Overview
This lab focuses on using **DOM access methods** in JavaScript to control page element properties. By combining these methods with **CSS animations** and the **w3.css library**, we enhance both usability and user experience.

## 🎯 Scenario/Summary
In this lab, you will:
- Build a simple web page containing:
  - An image
  - Sample text
  - A button
  - A popup form
- Use JavaScript to:
  - Access and control DOM elements
  - Hide the form initially
  - Show the form when the button is clicked
  - Animate the popup form as it appears
- Apply **w3.css styles** to make the page look professional.

This exercise demonstrates how JavaScript and CSS can work together to create interactive, modern UI components.
